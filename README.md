RAMADAN: THE MONTH OF MERCY
Ramadan, a time of boundless mercy, spiritual renewal, and unmatched blessings has arrived. This sacred month calls us to pause, reflect, and reconnect with our Creator.

It is a time when every prayer is amplified, every act of kindness is multiplied, and the gates of Jannah are opened wide for those who seek them.

Yet, while many of us gather to break our fasts in comfort, countless others face the harsh realities of hunger, displacement, and despair. 

Global Relief Trust is on the ground across many countries worldwide, with our Ramadan charity appeal 2025, delivering life-saving aid to those who need it most. From providing food parcels in Gaza and Syria to supporting Rohingya refugees and impoverished families around the world, your generosity fuels our mission to transform lives.

Your support for our Ramadan appeal can transform lives, bring hope, and multiply your blessings during this holy month.

Will you answer the call of compassion this Ramadan?

SAVE LIVES NOW



RAMADAN = HUGE REWRDS
Ramadan is Allah’s gift filled with mercy, forgiveness, and spiritual renewal.

The Prophet ﷺ said:

"When Ramadan begins, the gates of Paradise are opened, and the gates of Hell are closed, and the devils are chained."

Through fasting, a pillar of Islam, we purify our bodies and souls, fostering patience, gratitude, and mindfulness.
Ramadan provides unparalleled rewards for every act of worship and charity. 

The Prophet ﷺ said:

"Whoever fasts during Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his past sins will be forgiven."

The nights of Ramadan, graced by Taraweeh prayers and Laylat-ul-Qadr in the last 10, offer immense blessings,

Allah says: 

"The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months."

This is a sacred time to seek forgiveness and eternal closeness to Allah. 

Charity lies at the heart of Ramadan, embodying compassion and empathy. As narrated by Ibn Abbas (ra), the Prophet ﷺ was

"the most generous of people, and he was most generous during Ramadan."

Sadaqah and Zakat purify wealth, uplift communities, and multiply blessings. Supporting GRT’s Ramadan appeal ensures your Ramadan donations create lasting change for families in need.

GLOBAL RELIEF TRUST’S RAMADAN RESPONSE

This Ramadan, Global Relief Trust stands as a beacon of hope for those whose lives are marked by unimaginable hardship. In Gaza, families break their fast with little to no food, their homes shattered by conflict. In Yemen, children with hollow eyes fight for survival, their frail bodies a haunting reminder of the malnutrition crisis. In refugee camps across the world, the Rohingya endure another day of exile, longing for safety and dignity. Through our Ramadan charity appeal, GRT ensures your Ramadan donations transform despair into relief, bringing life-saving aid to those clinging to hope.

Your generosity fuels GRT’s mission to go beyond immediate relief. 

In Lebanon, where families are plunged into poverty, your donations provide essential food packs and medical assistance. In Syria, where the echoes of war still haunt communities, your support delivers clean water and resources to rebuild shattered lives. Every meal you help provide and every child you save reflects the essence of our Ramadan appeal, restoring hope and dignity to those in dire need.

In this sacred month, when every deed is multiplied, your support can change lives. Imagine the joy of a mother in Gaza who can finally feed her children, or the relief of a father in Yemen who receives food to nourish his family after weeks of hunger.

The Prophet ﷺ said 

"Allah is in the help of His servant as long as His servant is in the help of his brother."
